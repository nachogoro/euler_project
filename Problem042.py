# PROBLEM CONTENT:
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by tn=Â½n*(n+1); so
# the first ten triangle numbers are:
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
# alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
# example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10
# If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a
# triangle word.
#
# Using Problem042.data, a 16K text file containing
# nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
